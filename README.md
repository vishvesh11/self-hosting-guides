# My Homelab & Self-Hosting Guides

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my personal homelab setup and various self-hosted services. It's a living knowledge base detailing the architecture, configuration, and troubleshooting steps for the infrastructure I manage.

This project showcases my hands-on experience in system administration, networking, containerization, security, and automation, reflecting a passion for building, maintaining, and optimizing IT environments.

## üöÄ What's Inside?

This repository contains step-by-step guides, configuration snippets, and insights into setting up and managing a robust home server environment. You'll find documentation on:

- **Infrastructure Management:** Proxmox VE, ZFS storage configurations, and network architecture with pfSense.
- **Core Network Services:** Detailed setup for self-hosting email (Mailcow)\*, advanced VPN solutions (WireGuard, Tailscale), and centralized access dashboards (Homarr).
- **Application Hosting:** Deploying and managing various applications using Docker/Docker Compose, including Nginx Proxy Manager, Immich (photo management), Jellyfin (media server), and qBittorrent.
- **Home Automation & AI:** Configuring Home Assistant for smart home control and integrating AI-powered surveillance with Frigate and Google Coral TPU.
- **Security & Monitoring:** Strategies for securing services, managing SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt), and proactive system monitoring (Uptime Kuma).
- **Data Management:** Implementing robust backup strategies and file synchronization with Syncthing.

Each guide aims to provide practical, actionable steps and highlight key challenges and solutions encountered during implementation.

## üí° Why a Homelab?

My homelab serves as a personal sandbox for continuous learning, experimentation and gives me opportunity to make something my family can use. It allows us to:

- **Gain hands-on experience** with enterprise-grade and open-source technologies in a real-world environment.
- **Develop problem-solving skills** by troubleshooting complex interactions between hardware, software, and network components.
- **Explore new technologies** and understand their practical applications in a controlled setting.
- **Build a resilient and private personal infrastructure**, taking control of my data and services.
